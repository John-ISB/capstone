Capstone Project Charter 

 

 

 

The  Capstone  Project  Charter  is  a  formal  agreement  between  the  project  sponsor  and  the 

student  Team  working  on  the  Capstone  project  which  clearly  outlines  the  nature,  extent, 

scope, approach and deliverables of the project.  

The team is expected to deliver on all the commitments made in the project charter while the 

client is urged to actively participate in the creation of the project charter which then helps 

ensure that all stakeholders have consistent expectations from the project and agree on the 

approach and deliverables for the project. 

Once  the  project  charter  is  finalized,  no  deviations  can  be  undertaken  by  any  side  without 

consultation and approval of AMPBA program office.  

Each team will prepare a project charter as per the template given below. 
 
Please finalize this document in consultation with the sponsor and it is mandatory to obtain their 
sign-off on this project charter by the deadline mentioned below: 
 

Deadline for Project Charter – 14th Jan 2022 
 
It is mandatory for the team to interact with both the sponsor at least once, to discuss the 
charter, before you finalize it. 
 
It is mandatory to fill in every section of this form. 
 
Please  keep  the  project  charter  approach  and  deliverables  consistent  with  the  project 
description provided by the sponsor and his requirements for the project. 
 
If  the  scope,  deliverable,  or  schedule  requirements  of  the  project  change  significantly,  a 
‘Change Request’ should be submitted by the sponsor to the AMPBA program office. This 
request  must  be  approved  by  us,  in  consultation  with  the  faculty,  to  protect  teams  from 
scope creep during the project.

Project Description  

(as per PD form) 

IPO prospectus has 300-400 pages of information. For an average 
retail investor, its very difficult to follow this information and 
compare against peers. The project aims to make this systematic by 
extracting the required information from IPO prospectus. In the first 
phase of the project, you will do review of academic literature to 
define the aspects that define post IPO performance and signify a 
good quality issue. In the second phase you will write code to 
automatically process IPO prospectus to extract these parameters and 
annotate the PDF by highlighting the area that was used to extract the 
information for tracking.  
Overall the aim of this project is to setup basic NLP, Entity 
Recognition and parsing technology and define analytics around peer 
group analysis including foreign peers. For this project, we will 
specifically focus on relatively unknown but upcoming SME IPO 
segment. The key difference is that these are fully underwritten 

 

 

instead of main board listing which is best effort raise by the 
investment banker.  
Factors that we would look for are promoters, related party 
disclosures, litigations, industry dynamics, peers, past performance 
by its bankers etc. 

 

PROJECT PLANNING 

Business Issue:  

-  Business Context 

It is difficult for an investor to read through a 300+ page IPO document to understand 
about the company and do a peer comparison. This results in investors’ not having the 
adequate know how of the company’s performance which in turn might result in investors 
staying away from IPOs or making uninformed bets. 
 
Further, today a lot of financial details are churned to assess the performance of a 
company, but the non-financial data is not taken much into account. There could be some 
critical insights in the non-financial data which could enable the investor make an 
informed decision. 
 

-  Area of impact 

The investors will be guided towards better / more informed and unbiased decision 
making. 

 

Need Gap Situation : 

Current Situation 

Current Situation: 

Proposed 
Approach 

Desired Situation 

 

  The investor either relies on the insights / forecasts of various securities agencies to decide 

on the investment Or analyses the documents him/herself and does a peer comparison.  
  There is no module / application with the sponsor which can automatically parse an IPO 
document and extract critical information. Also the metrics for scoring an IPO document 
on the non financial parameters are not available. 

 

Proposed Approach: 

  Do an extensive secondary research to understand the critical non financial parameters that 

defines success of an IPO. Identify research papers and other documents to develop this 
understanding and come up with metrics to score a document 

  Prepare train and test data set. 

 

 

  Extract relevant data and perform EDA 
  Prepare a model to score the document basis the details extracted. Test on the test data and 

make it better 

Desired Situation 

  An IPO document fed by the user gets auto scanned and gives a score to the IPO 

Proposed Project Work Flow: 
 
Define metrics to be measured / monitored  

  Access sources such as Google scholar, Ebsco (LMS resource) and internet in general to 

identify research work done in this domain.  

Interact with ISB faculties to get their insights on the topic as well 

 
  Define a criteria in discussion with the sponsor and the guide for choosing any metric for 

assessment 

  Finalize the metrics iteratively 

Define Success / Failure criteria of an IPO 

  Secondary research for defining successful IPOs 
  Study the performance of IPOs in the last 5 years  
  Analyze data to identify patterns / groups 
  Finalize the criteria 

Code to extract data from documents 
  Parse the file and read relevant data 
  Use existing libraries and customized codes wherever needed 
  Format and clean the data extracted for further use 
  Feature engineering 

Build and test model 
 
Evaluate the model and deploy 
 

Data Plan and Software requirement for each deliverable: 
Data requirements :  

1.  Access to Refinitiv database of more than 20000 companies. This data includes financial 

results, price data and also peer data 

2.  IPO prospectus from the financial sites. (200 documents will be provided by the sponsor) 

 
Data collection: 
Some of prospectus documents would be fetched by ourselves and some would be 
provided by the sponsor. 
 
Data security: 
We will ensure that no part of the code will be shared publicly as well as try to use tools 
like Google Colab so that the code is available in one place. While the hosting can be 
anywhere we will try to store the trained model in a pickle file or an API to reuse it. 

 

 

 
Software used: 
We will be using Python to parse the PDF files, extract named entities and create the 
model.
